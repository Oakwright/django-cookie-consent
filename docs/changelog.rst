0.4.0 (in development)
----------------------

.. note:: These release notes are incomplete!

.. note:: The 0.4.0 release has had a project management overhaul. There are no
   functional changes (yet) to the project, but things *around the project* have changed.
   Please check the release notes carefully.


**Breaking changes**

* Dropped support for Django 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1
* Dropped support for Python 3.6

These versions are end-of-life and no longer supported by their upstream teams.

* Replaced Travis CI with Github Actions (#64, #75)
* Set up correct test matrix for python/django versions (#75)
* Code is now ``isort`` and ``black`` formatted (#75)
* Set up ``tox`` and ``pytest`` for testing (#64, #75)
* 'Removed' the example app - the ``testapp`` in the repository is still a good example
